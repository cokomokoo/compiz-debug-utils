# Compiz Debug Utilities

A few helper utilities for those who want to help debug compiz. Here's what
each script does (with more documentation embedded in their help outputs):

- **compiz-send.py**: Examine dbus properties and call dbus methods. Adapted
  and improved from <http://wiki.compiz.org/Plugins/Dbus>.
- **detach-bt.py**: Helper script to make grabbing debug log files for compiz
  segfaults easier.
